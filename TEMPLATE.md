**To the Stakeholders of Earth:**

It is easy to feel that progress has stalled—that outside of AI, "nothing ever happens." We struggle to connect the dots between scientific funding and the impact on our daily lives.

This view is incorrect. We are on the precipice of distinct revolutions in energy, biology, and space. But science has a communication problem. It reports isolated discoveries, not strategic progress.

**This newsletter is our weekly report to the Board of Humanity.**

We do not view science as an abstract pursuit, but as the engine of material abundance. We track the needle on five Grand Endeavors that will determine the quality of life for the next 100 years. We reject the inevitability of scarcity and decline; we believe the only credible path forward is solving our material problems through exponential efficiency and innovation.

Here is where humanity stands this week.
