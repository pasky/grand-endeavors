# Five Grand Endeavors

Tracking humanity's progress in five grand endeavors --- our biggest ongoing R&D projects:

* Robots (and Automation overall)
* Rockets (and Space overall)
* Fusion (and Energy overall)
* Cancer (and Healthspan overall)
* Climate (and Environment overall)

The initial purpose of this project is using AI to automatically compose a regular trustworthy report to "the Board of Humanity" about major progress in these areas.


### Manifesto

Science has a communication problem. It reports isolated discoveries (with the applications often more of an afterthought question), not progress towards the big outcomes. Thus, every week, we publish a newsletter updating the humanity on the progress of science towards such outcomes - just as a company would report its progress to its board.

Scientific research is valuable even to its own end, but is largely expected to be the engine of material abundance. We track the needle on five Grand Endeavors that humanity pursued for all its existence and that will also determine the quality of life for the next 100 years.

Each of the endeavors has a KPI assigned, as well as some key milestones and open challenges we need to solve.  All of these may update and evolve over time, and are on purpose somewhat opinionated - they capture the current consensus rather than all perspectives.  If the top experts' consensus shifts, we will shift.  And we will report also on major progress of alternative approaches in each given area.

## Robots and Automation

Humans were looking to automate their lives in one way or another for most of their existence. From early domesticated animals to microwave ovens and freighter ships, automation adds a huge multiplier on human labor - we can either do more with our time, or spend less time working. The current frontier is automating intelligence - the software (AI) and the hardware (robots).

### Software

**KPI:** 80-percentile METR task length equivalent (Human-hours)

**Milestone Countdown:**
*   **The Linux Kernel Patch:** An AI-submitted large (10k+ lines diff) patch to the Linux Kernel (or equivalent critical infra) is accepted by maintainers.
*   **The Nature Author:** An AI-generated research paper is accepted by a top-tier journal (Nature/Science) with AI credited as primary author.
*   **The $10M Solopreneur:** A single-person company reaches $10M ARR, proving AI capacity for complex economic agency.

**Major Open Challenges** (assuming "LLMs are enough" hypothesis)
*   **Reliability:** Reducing hallucinations and error compounding in long chains of reasoning.
*   **Agency:** Robust goal decomposition and self-correction over long time horizons.
*   **Continuous Learning:** Universal mechanism for rapidly adjusting long-term behavior based on past experiences.
*   **Novelty:** Consistently producing original connections beyond interpolations of existing knowledge.

### Hardware

**KPI:** Largest Active Commercial Fleet of General-Purpose Humanoids (Single Site)

**Milestone Countdown:**

*   **Generalization:** Few-shot skill acquisition, robust task transfer across environments, recovery from unexpected failures, and long-horizon replanning without human intervention.
*   **Power/Efficiency/Cost:** Extending 1-2 hour runtimes to full 8-hour shifts via battery breakthroughs or radical actuator efficiency gains, at commercially viable price points.

## Rockets and Space

What child hasn't looked once at the starry sky in wonder? The universe promises many worlds humanity could spread to - removing some eggs from the "one basket", a new age of discovery, making all raw materials cheap, and vast opportunities for community independence. And if nothing else, transport by orbital flights is the next best thing to travel by teleport, allowing you to reach the opposite side of the globe in 90 minutes.

**KPI:** Cost to LEO ($/kg)

**Milestone Countdown:**
*   **"The Deluge":** 15,000 tons delivered to orbit in a single year.
*   **"The Homestead":** Permanent crewed base operates 1+ year using local resources (Moon or Mars).
*   **"The Export":** Product manufactured in space is sold commercially on Earth (beyond novelty items).

**Major Open Challenges:**
*   **Radiation Shielding:** Protecting crew from cosmic and solar radiation during months-long deep space transits.
*   **Closed-Loop Life Support:** Years-long operation without resupply from Earth.
*   **ISRU at Scale:** Production-level extraction of fuel, oxygen, and materials from planetary resources.

## Fusion and Energy

Energy is the key limiting factor of the material world. It does not have to be. If all electricity bills go to zero, how does that change our lives, from heating (homes, iron or saltwater) to food, to travel, to compute? There are many short-term fixes, but the long-term approach is unlikely to be anything but nuclear fusion (and superconductors make everything easier).

**KPI:** Worldwide average electricity cost ($/MWh)

**Universal Milestones:**
*   **"The First Watt":** First commercial fusion plant delivers sustained electricity to a public grid.
*   **"Grid Parity":** Fusion LCOE falls below $100/MWh, competitive with gas.

### D-T Path (mainstream)

Uses deuterium-tritium fuel — easiest to ignite, but produces 14 MeV neutrons that damage materials and requires breeding tritium.

**Magnetic Confinement (MCF):** Tokamaks (CFS, ITER), stellarators (Type One), Z-pinch (Zap Energy)
*   *Milestone:* Q>10 sustained — power-plant-viable physics demonstrated.
*   *Challenges:* Plasma stability and heat exhaust; materials surviving neutron bombardment for years.

**Inertial Confinement (ICF):** Lasers (NIF, Xcimer), projectile (First Light)
*   *Milestone:* 10 Hz rep-rate with cheap targets — proving pulsed approach can scale.
*   *Challenges:* Driver efficiency (lasers ~1% today, need 10%+); target cost ($50k→$0.10).

**Shared D-T Challenges:**
*   **Tritium breeding:** Blankets must achieve TBR>1.05 — never demonstrated at scale.
*   **14 MeV neutron damage:** No material proven to survive power-plant duty cycles.

### Aneutronic Path (high-risk, high-reward)

Uses fuels like D-He3 (Helion) or p-B11 (TAE) — far fewer neutrons, no tritium breeding needed, but requires 10× higher temperatures and has lower reaction rates.

*   *Milestone:* Net electricity from aneutronic fusion demonstrated.
*   *Challenges:* Reaching and confining 1+ billion °C plasma; achieving net gain despite unfavorable cross-sections.

**The Race:** Helion (D-He3, pulsed FRC) targets 2028 grid via Microsoft PPA. CFS (D-T tokamak) targets early 2030s. TAE (p-B11) targets early 2030s. ITER's Q=10 demo delayed to late 2030s.

### Alternative Path: Deep Geothermal

If drilling gets cheap enough, Earth's heat is abundant everywhere — no plasma physics required. Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) fracture hot rock at depth; newer approaches (Quaise, GA Drilling) use millimeter-wave or plasma drilling to reach 10-20 km where rock is 400°C+ anywhere on Earth.

*   *Milestone:* Commercial power from a deep closed-loop well (>10 km depth).
*   *Challenges:* Drilling cost and speed at extreme depths; long-term reservoir performance unknown.

Potential to leapfrog fusion if drilling breakthroughs arrive first — LCOE projections as low as $20/MWh.

## Cancer and Healthspan

Some people long for immortality, others would just prefer not to die (or live low-quality life) *yet*. The biggest symbol for fixing this is our journey to cure cancer, but the fight with other diseases such as Alzheimer's (or potential pandemics), as well as perfected early diagnostics, are just as important. And to achieve not just plain longevity, but long healthy lifespan, eventually we need to move further to evolve our biology, not just fight off diseases.

**KPI:** Top 5 countries median lifespan or healthspan tbd (y)

**Milestone Countdown:** (top 5 causes of death/disability and timelines to improve efficacy of treatment by 50%?)

**Mini Tech Tree:** (tbd mermaid)

## Climate and Environment

This endeavor is unlike the other four, as it is about fixing the past rather than improving the future. 100 years ago, we would have been talking about terraforming Sahara and Antarctica, but humanity messed up the Earth. Many historic civilizations died of climate change, and we now have to clean up our mess if we are to survive into a better future.

**KPI:** CO2 concentration ppm, methane concentration ppm; and y2y gradient

**Milestone Countdown:** (years to CO2 change breakeven, and years to biggest projected shifts in gradient + why)

## Supplemental

### The Knowledge Beyond

A great enabler for the future is deep understanding of our universe and the ability to manipulate it on fine scale. Paradigm-breaking technologies like quantum computing and nanomachines, as well as new theoretical research, may not impact any of the great endeavors directly, but they will reframe everything in the long run.

### Society and Cohesion

As humanity progresses in its great endeavors, many challenges await our society. To survive into the future, we must pass the great filters - avoid wiping ourselves out with weapons of mass destruction, align our robots (align with *what*?) and learn to coexist with them (a new alien intelligence), as well as keep humans in some relationships with one another and the physical world. Meanwhile, trust is breaking, alienation and polarization is growing, and simulacra are getting more attractive than the real world. But society can adapt - 40 years ago, "open source" wasn't really a concept, but we fought off massive corporate capture and it now underpins vast areas of technology and knowledge (think: Wikipedia). What is the next philosophy, sociology and social technologies best serving humanity's future?
